excerpt: "Economist | Data Scientist"
---

I am currently looking for a position as a data scientist, data analyst or economist with a strong quantitative focus. I am very passionate about statistics and machine learning, programming and causal inference.
 
In August 2020 I completed my PhD in economics at ETH Zurich. My [PhD thesis](projects/Doctoral_Thesis_EM.pdf) consists of methodological and applied essays on the identification and estimation of causal effects with observational data. In one chapter, I analyzed the estimation of causal effects using machine learning methods. To illustrate my findings, I created an [interactive web app](https://eliasmoor.shinyapps.io/mlevaluation/) with Shiny. The corresponding R code can be found on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/emoor/mlevaluation).

For more infos about my PhD thesis and my other projects, please visit the [projects](/projects/) page.

In my leisure time I like playing tennis, swimming in the river or hiking in the mountains. If the season doesn't allow this, I enjoy reading a book or two.
