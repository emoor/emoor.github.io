excerpt: "Data Scientist | Economist"
---

I completed my PhD in economics at ETH Zurich. My [PhD thesis](projects/Doctoral_Thesis_EM.pdf) consists of methodological and applied essays on the identification and estimation of causal effects with observational data. In one chapter, I apply machine learning methods to estimate causal effects. To illustrate my findings, I created an [interactive web app](https://eliasmoor.shinyapps.io/mlevaluation/) with Shiny. The corresponding R code can be found on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/emoor/mlevaluation). I am very passionate about statistics and machine learning, programming and causal inference. In March 2021, I joined QuantCo as a data scientist.
