excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am currently looking for a position as a data scientist, data analyst or economist with a strong quantitative focus. I am very passionate about statistics and machine learning, data visualization and causal inference.
 
In August 2020 I completed my PhD in economics at ETH Zurich. My [PhD thesis](projects/Doctoral_Thesis_EM.pdf) consists of methodological and applied chapters on the identification and estimation of causal effects with observational data. In one chapter, I evaluated whether machine learning methods can be applied to estimate causal effects more accurately. To illustrate my findings, I created an [interactive web app](https://eliasmoor.shinyapps.io/mlevaluation/) with Shiny. 

For more infos about my [PhD thesis](projects/Doctoral_Thesis_EM.pdf) and my other projects, please visit my [projects](/projects/) page.

In my leisure time I like playing tennis, swimming in the river or hiking in the moutains. If the season doesn't allow this, I like to go jogging or reading a book.
